     * Examples: Siri, Chess engines, Recommendation systems
   - General/Strong AI (AGI)
     * Human-level reasoning
     * Consciousness and self-awareness
   - Super AI (ASI)
     * Theoretical future AI surpassing human intelligence

3. **Real-world Applications**
   - Healthcare (diagnosis, drug discovery)
   - Finance (fraud detection, trading)
   - Transportation (autonomous vehicles)
   - Entertainment (gaming, content creation)
   - Security (facial recognition, threat detection)

### Machine Learning Fundamentals
1. **Core Concepts**
   - Training and inference
   - Features and labels
   - Models and algorithms
